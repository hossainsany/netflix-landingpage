# Netflix Landing Page Recreation

This project is a recreation of Netflix's landing page using HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript. It includes several interactive elements, such as background videos, animated gifs, an interactive accordion, and a call-to-action (CTA) button to encourage visitors to subscribe to Netflix.
